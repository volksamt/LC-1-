<h2> Copy </h2>
LC-1 is an armament designed to turn you into an Artiste-Agitator.

With its compact build, highly variable frequency range, and ferocious output power of 3Vpp, LC-1 is the perfect sonic infiltration tool
 for jam sessions and free-improvisation ensembles alike. 

It is crafted in alignment with Volksamt!â€™s artistic manifesto;

*
Hierarchy and harmony are shackles unto everything!
FcCUk order!

However, 
it would be absurd to send you to the fronts without sufficient training.
Thus;

designed to boost your acumen.
Rehearse these well.

Feel free to experiment with the capacitor values as everybodies skin resistance is different. Usually 22nF is a good stating point.
